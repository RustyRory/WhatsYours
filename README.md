# 🎨 What's Yours? — Serious Game (English Game Week)

Welcome to **What's Yours?**, a serious game created as part of our **English Game Week**, bringing together several digital fields of **My Digital School Angers**:  
**Web Development, Cybersecurity, Digital Creation, and Digital Marketing.**  
Our goal is to design an educational game in English focused on **Brand Design** (logos, colors, typography, slogans, brand identity…).

This repository contains all resources related to the development, design, and rules of the game.

## 🧠 Concept

**What's Yours?** is a game inspired by the classic _Guess Who?_, adapted to the world of **branding**.  
Players must guess the brand chosen by their opponent by asking **yes/no questions**, eliminating possibilities along the way.

A game is played **1 vs 1**, lasts around **20 minutes**, and includes **mini-games** to make each round more dynamic while helping players learn branding fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Game Objective

Guess the brand card selected by your opponent **before they guess yours**, using closed yes/no questions related to:

- Icons
- Typography
- Brand Identity
- Colors
- Slogans

The first player to win **3 rounds** becomes the **Guess Champion**.

---

## 🎲 Required Materials

- A game board with **16 doors** per player
- **Brand cards** (to insert behind the doors)
- **Learning sheets** (brief explanations of each branding theme)
- **Mini-game cards** (Easy / Medium / Difficult)

---

## 📘 Setup

1. Give each player a board with all 16 doors open.
2. Shuffle the cards by topic and place them on the table.
3. Each player secretly selects one card.
4. Keep your doors open facing you, hidden from your opponent.

⚠️ If a player accidentally sees the opponent’s card, the round must be restarted.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

### 🔍 Asking Questions

- The youngest player starts.
- Each turn, a player asks **one yes/no question** to eliminate options.
- Depending on the answer:
  - **YES →** close all doors that _don’t_ match the description.
  - **NO →** close all doors that _do_ match the described element.

**Example:**  
_“Is your font cursive?”_  
→ If the answer is _yes_, the player closes all non-cursive fonts.

---

## 🧩 Mini-Games

Each player may play **one mini-game card per round** (maximum one per player).  
The mini-game applies to _both_ players.  
➡️ The winner earns **one extra question** during their turn.

Each theme has its own mini-game, with two difficulty levels:

### 🞄 Icons

- **Easy:** Choose the correct logo among four similar icons.
- **Difficult:** Identify the brand from a partially incomplete icon.

### 🞄 Typography

- **Easy:** Find the correct typography associated with a brand name.
- **Difficult:** Guess the brand from a sentence written in its iconic font style.

### 🞄 Brand Identity

- **Easy:** Match a keyword to the correct brand.
- **Medium/Difficult:** Branding quiz about tools, values, or brand culture.

### 🞄 Colors

- **Easy:** Guess the brand from a black-and-white logo.
- **Difficult:** Guess the brand from its color pattern alone.

### 🞄 Slogans

- **Easy:** Choose the correct slogan between two options.
- **Difficult:** Identify the brand from a French slogan translated into English.

## 🏆 Winning the Game

A player may choose to **guess the opponent’s card** instead of asking a question.

- If the guess is correct → **the player instantly wins the round**.
- If the guess is incorrect → **the player instantly loses the round**.

The first player to win **3 rounds** becomes the **What's Yours Champion**.
