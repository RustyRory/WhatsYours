            <h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of <strong>"What's yours?"</strong> is to guess the
              element your opponent has chosen before they guess yours by asking
              yes/no questions related to the chosen sheet. There are 5 topics
              (sheets), you can start with any of them :
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Icons</li>
              <li>Typography</li>
              <li>Brand Identity</li>
              <li>Colors</li>
              <li>Slogans</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="card shadow-sm p-4 mb-4">
            <h2>🎲 Setup</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Each player receives their own set of 5 sheets.</li>
              <li>
                Place the extra-cards (mini games) by color/theme and place them
                on the table.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each sheet has flippable doors containing the elements. Players
                keep their doors open at the start and close them as they
                eliminate possibilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a player accidentally sees the opponent’s card, restart the
                round.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="card shadow-sm p-4 mb-4">
            <h2>🕹️ Gameplay</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                All players have to read the documentary of each sheet to learn
                the basics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Scan the QR Code (on the recto) and create your game before
                starting the game.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then choose a sheet to start with (Both players must use the
                same sheet for the round).
              </li>
              <li>Choose a topic.</li>
              <li>The youngest player starts.</li>
              <li>Ask one yes/no question per turn to eliminate options.</li>
              <li>
                Depending on the answer:
                <ul>
                  <li>YES → close doors that don’t match</li>
                  <li>NO → close doors that do match</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Take turns asking questions and ruling out possibilities.</li>
              <li>
                Use mini-game cards (1 per round) to gain an extra question.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              💥 Whenever you want, use mini-game cards (1 per round and per
              player). The winner immediately gains one additional question !
            </p>

              <li>If correct → win the round immediately.</li>
